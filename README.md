# Aquarium-Monitor
Python-based aquarium monitor program to interface with the Numato 16 channel GPIO module. Can be adapted to other GPIO devices. The monitor program requires Python3 but no higher than Python 3.11. It uses the telnet class that has been deprecated in Python 3.11 and removed in 3.13. There are no immediate plans to support running in 3.13+. The program design has a main that constructs an GpioCtl object and loops calling methods on the GpioCtl object instantiation. Main will stay in a continuous loop until an exception causes it to exit. A keyboard exception would be the only expected exiting condition. The input to the program is a config.txt file expected to be in the current directory. This file is composed of two main sections. The first section assigns the GPIO numbers of the hardware to various classes to read and process the sensor date connected to those GPIO inputs. Some examples are classes to monitor temperature, PH, and light. The various classes derived from a base GPIO class which is divided into GPIO Analog and GPIO Digital. The second section of the configuration file contains network and sampling configuration data.  MORE TO COME....
